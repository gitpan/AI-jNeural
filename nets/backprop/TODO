Paul:
  Make the varargs new() call less stupid in the .xs

  add href calling for the .pm ->new

  kill all array calls in the .pm

  split the train_on and test_for calls from the train()
      so they can be used separately

Fred:
  add jiggle (jitter?) to the C libjneural and add the jitter 
      back to the .xs here

  add set_alpha support to the C, xs and .pm  
      (for variable alpha during training/testing?)

  possibly help redo the docs
      way too early for this since the interface changes
      randomly
